## Does it do things?
### Smaller words
I'm *not* sure what I'm doing.

## Syntax Highlighting Test
Just try some different languages out, see how it all flows together. Get a feel for the system.
#### Python
```python
def square_me(x=1):
    return x ** 2
```

#### PHP
```php
public function square_me(int $x = 1) {
    return $x ^ 2;
}
```
