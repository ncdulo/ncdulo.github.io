Somewhere I can
write about the things on my mind. Somewhere I can share, or catalog the bits
and pieces of information I pick up over time. I've even made a few attempts at
it before, with various levels of effort and completion. Yet for the most part,
I have not stuck with previous attempts long term. Most of them falling into
inactivity not long after the first or second post was made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through this process again, I'm not going to say, "this time will be
different". I will say that I've been very much enjoying this, and having fun
with it. Something I'm not sure I did in some previous attempts. There are also
several notable differences to me that seem to factor in to play here.&lt;/p&gt;

It's
infancy began some months ago, but never quite got off the ground. Then about a
week ago, a rekindled interest sparked up. And just like that -- here we are!
Reaching a point now where I feel comfortable with this base, I'd like to get
this online. For final testing, and of course to open up for visitors. These
are my final thoughts as I prepare for a proper deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
