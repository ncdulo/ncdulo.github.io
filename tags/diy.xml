when I moved out of my parent's house it's cooking. Not that I relied heavily on
my mom much for food -- I was pretty good at covering my own expenses when
living at home. But you don't truly realize &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that is already taken
care of for you until you have to take care of everything yourself. You know,
the little things. Keeping a well stocked pantry. Having a wide variety of
cooking utensils and devices. Making sure the rent check is out on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being out on my own has really given me a good push to branch out into cooking
more, expand my horizons, and gain more ambition in what I cook. You can't just
live off of Pizza Rolls and M&amp;amp;M's forever -- it starts to get boring after a bit.
Though I have had some great results at times, I've also had some not so great
results. Tonight's dinner was actually pretty good, but I made a few mistakes
along the way and learned a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

solutions. Part of that is the obvious, saving money. When you're already
stretched thin, every dollar you can save is a big help. But another part,
seemingly the bigger draw for me -- being able to say, "I did this". Having
the ability to take of things on your own, without reliance on other people, or
factors can really take a lot of stress off the mind. As the Coronavirus
pandemic continues to work through our world, there is a greater growing
interest in DIY once again. Seems as good a time as any to go over some of my
own ways for saving money, and getting things done on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
