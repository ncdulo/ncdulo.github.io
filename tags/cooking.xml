This is more about my experiences cooking, tips I've picked up along the way, maybe even a recipe or two. The chemistry behind cooking is great too.</description><atom:link href="https://ncdulo.github.io/tags/cooking.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"></atom:link><language>en</language><copyright>Contents © 2020 &lt;a href="https://github.com/ncdulo"&gt;ncdulo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"&gt;

when I moved out of my parent's house it's cooking. Not that I relied heavily on
my mom much for food -- I was pretty good at covering my own expenses when
living at home. But you don't truly realize &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that is already taken
care of for you until you have to take care of everything yourself. You know,
the little things. Keeping a well stocked pantry. Having a wide variety of
cooking utensils and devices. Making sure the rent check is out on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being out on my own has really given me a good push to branch out into cooking
more, expand my horizons, and gain more ambition in what I cook. You can't just
live off of Pizza Rolls and M&amp;amp;M's forever -- it starts to get boring after a bit.
Though I have had some great results at times, I've also had some not so great
results. Tonight's dinner was actually pretty good, but I made a few mistakes
along the way and learned a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
