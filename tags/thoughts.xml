While
initially a massive learning curve to begin grasping I found it extremely
powerful and intriguing. The first few days were quite challenging but I was
slowly finding my way through and thoroughly enjoying myself. Realizing the
power that was in my hands with &lt;cite&gt;Emacs Lisp&lt;/cite&gt;, I couldn't help but dive headfirst
into configuring and tweaking into the perfect development and editor for
myself.&lt;/p&gt;

the switch. The new default &lt;cite&gt;Python&lt;/cite&gt; version is &lt;cite&gt;Python 3.7&lt;/cite&gt;! I was not
totally sure just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to expect with this update. Surely some things would
go wrong, and I would encounter some issues somewhere. As it turns out, I was
wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

when I moved out of my parent's house it's cooking. Not that I relied heavily on
my mom much for food -- I was pretty good at covering my own expenses when
living at home. But you don't truly realize &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that is already taken
care of for you until you have to take care of everything yourself. You know,
the little things. Keeping a well stocked pantry. Having a wide variety of
cooking utensils and devices. Making sure the rent check is out on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being out on my own has really given me a good push to branch out into cooking
more, expand my horizons, and gain more ambition in what I cook. You can't just
live off of Pizza Rolls and M&amp;amp;M's forever -- it starts to get boring after a bit.
Though I have had some great results at times, I've also had some not so great
results. Tonight's dinner was actually pretty good, but I made a few mistakes
along the way and learned a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

Somewhere I can
write about the things on my mind. Somewhere I can share, or catalog the bits
and pieces of information I pick up over time. I've even made a few attempts at
it before, with various levels of effort and completion. Yet for the most part,
I have not stuck with previous attempts long term. Most of them falling into
inactivity not long after the first or second post was made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through this process again, I'm not going to say, "this time will be
different". I will say that I've been very much enjoying this, and having fun
with it. Something I'm not sure I did in some previous attempts. There are also
several notable differences to me that seem to factor in to play here.&lt;/p&gt;
