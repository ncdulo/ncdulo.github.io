solutions. Part of that is the obvious, saving money. When you're already
stretched thin, every dollar you can save is a big help. But another part,
seemingly the bigger draw for me -- being able to say, "I did this". Having
the ability to take of things on your own, without reliance on other people, or
factors can really take a lot of stress off the mind. As the Coronavirus
pandemic continues to work through our world, there is a greater growing
interest in DIY once again. Seems as good a time as any to go over some of my
own ways for saving money, and getting things done on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
