# Sandbox
Try out some markdown. Spitball ideas. Dump random crap here. Just a place to try things where I won't break existing content.

## Tables
Keep in mind a table must have an empty line before (possibly after as well) it to properly render.

| Language | Comptency | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| C/C++ | Moderate | Functional knowledge of the langauge. Missing higher level OOP concepts, templates and STL familiarity. |
| Python | Basic | Very new to the language. Followed some tutorial projects to get the jist of the syntax. Currently reading through Dive Into Python for a fuller understanding of the language |
| PHP | Moderate | Long history of use but mostly on PHP <=5. Comfortable with language but need to improve real-world skills. | 
| Javascript | Basic to None | Made a couple attempts at learning when I was young. Did not go well and I have been scared to go back. More recently have been looking to attempt the language again. |
| x86_64 Assembly | Basic | I understand the syntax and can determine what is going on in a piece of code. However the ability to write my own code from scratch is non-existent. |
