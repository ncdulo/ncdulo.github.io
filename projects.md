## Dotfiles
### [emacs.d/](https://github.com/ncdulo/emacsd)
My own customized emacs configuration/distribution. Contains some major bugs and requires a full re-write.

Collection of xmonad and friends configuration. Has not been used since ~2012-13 and relied on several external programs. Should still be possible to get working though.
## Python

Simple python 3.6 roguelike based on the Revised LibTCOD Tutorial.
