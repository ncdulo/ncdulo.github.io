### [emacs.d/](https://github.com/ncdulo/emacsd)
My own customized emacs configuration/distribution. Contains some major bugs and requires a full re-write.
### [xmonad](https://github.com/ncdulo/xmonad)
Collection of xmonad and friends configuration. Has not been used since ~2012-13 and relied on several external programs. Should still be possible to get working though.

## Miscellaneous
### [fortune-mod-mythical-linux](https://github.com/ncdulo/fortune-mod-mythical-linux)
A collection of various Phate-isms and Tredixions. Mod for `fortune` which displays an assorted collection of quotes from the Mythical Linux Discord. More of a fun project for me and members on the discord, but free for anyone who is interested to enjoy.
