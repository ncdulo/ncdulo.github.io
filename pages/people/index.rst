Mythical entities
-----------------
Meet a few of the people I have collaborated with, or those who I share my free
time with. This group forming the core of the Mythical Linux community. In no
particular order, we've got...

`ncdulo`_
  Maintainer of this site, and several other projects on GitHub in various
  stages of completion.

`phate`_
  Creator of `rsfetch`_, and other utilities. Ring 1 Mythical status, Rustacean,
  Elder Scrolls loremaster.

`arctic`_
  Beginning into the depths of programming, learning developer. Ring 1 Mythical status

`vitor`_
  Physics student, and LaTeX enthusiast (LaTeX rocks!). Ring 0 Mythical status

`dmt`_
  Possibly the wisest of them all, eats Emacs for breakfast.

`shardion`_
  Creator of `pyrobot`_, data center maintainer. Best served with a side of ``ech``.

Assorted humans
---------------
There are a few other people who stand out to me, either for their notable works
or for their efforts in the developer and open source communities. Like above,
no particular order here for now. If anything, the order they appear on my GitHub
"Following" list. Otherwise, just humans.

`Michal Górny`_
  Gentoo and FreeBSD developer. Most notable to me because of his work towards
  the `Gentoo Python`_ project and his own `blog`_ with quite a bit of history.

`Steve Purcell`_
  Full-stack developer who I originally noticed through his work into Emacs,
  even basing my own (destined to fail) Emacs configuration off his own. Creator
  of `PyUnit`_ which is now part of the `Python` standard library as ``unittest``.
  Maintains another wonderful blog at `Sanity, inc`_.
