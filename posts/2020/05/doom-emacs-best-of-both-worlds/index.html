    <div>
<p>For a couple months last year, I became borderline obsessed with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. While
initially a massive learning curve to begin grasping I found it extremely
powerful and intriguing. The first few days were quite challenging but I was
slowly finding my way through and thoroughly enjoying myself. Realizing the
power that was in my hands with <cite>Emacs Lisp</cite>, I couldn&#8217;t help but dive headfirst
into configuring and tweaking into the perfect development and editor for&nbsp;myself.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>With no prior experience with <cite>Lisp</cite>, not even realizing it was still in use in
the current day and age, I was very surprised at what something so simple (in
theory) could accomplish. It was not without headache and frustration though. It
seemed like every documentation, or introduction to <cite>Emacs Lisp</cite> was way over my
head and would require nothing short of a Computer Science degree to make sense
of. All this talk of <code class="docutils literal">cons</code>, <code class="docutils literal">car</code>, and <code class="docutils literal">cdr</code> was enough to make my head
spin. Somehow, I trudged through and began tweaking my configuration. Simple
things. Nicer font. New colors. <a class="reference external" href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/rainbow-mode.html">Rainbow Mode</a>. The list goes&nbsp;on.</p>
<div class="section" id="it-was-never-enough">
<h2>It was never&nbsp;enough</h2>
<p>Thoughts of unlimited power coursed through my veins as I dove deeper into
the possibilities. I spent days (probably even weeks) tweaking and refining
an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">org-mode</span></code> configuration based on the <a class="reference external" href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> system. It
even inspired me enough to buy the book, which I sadly haven&#8217;t finished reading.
I was hooked, entranced by the power presented to me, with no practical
knowledge of how to apply it. That wouldn&#8217;t stop me though. Not&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>The deeper I dove, the more I began to see problems in my <code class="docutils literal">init.el</code> &amp; friends.
Simple solution? Try out some of the more minimal <cite>Emacs</cite> distributions and
configurations available online. Many of them were great, and I was particularly
fond of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d">Purcell</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a> setups. Even using each of them for some
time on my own, expanding as necessary. Yet still finding reasons for wanting
more a totally custom setup. Eventually basing my last configuration off of
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/editor-bootstrap/emacs-bootstrap">Emacs Bootstrap</a> and setting off with a mostly blank slate and sensible&nbsp;defaults.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jumping-in-the-deep-end-with-no-idea-how-to-swim">
<h2>Jumping in the deep end, with no idea how to&nbsp;swim</h2>
<p>Each passing day, I spent hours reading, adjusting and adding packages. At the
time I wasn&#8217;t even working on any projects <em>except</em> for this <cite>Emacs</cite> config.
Yet I was setting things up for languages I hadn&#8217;t touched in years. Things
mostly worked, but frequently they didn&#8217;t. Strange errors popped up that left me
spending hours working to fix them. In some cases even entirely scrapping
whichever idea I had that I could not realize into code. My config quickly
became a horrible mess that <em>I</em> could hardly make sense of, let alone anyone&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>In the beginning of October 2019 I migrated back home to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>, taking my
<cite>Emacs</cite> configuration with me. Mind you, before the migration, I was having
some strange errors which would totally lock up <cite>Emacs</cite> to the point it required
a little <cite>kill -s SIGKILL</cite> love to take down. As much as I attempted to track
down the issue, I could not figure it out. My config was too far gone, and too
far broken. Between that, and a couple issues other issues that seemed more
specific to how I built <cite>Emacs</cite>, it became unbearable. I just could not get any
work done. It might crash in five minutes, or it might take five hours. It got
to me. Bad. Eventually, I had enough and rage-purged <cite>Emacs</cite> from my system and
made it a point to learn <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. After all, it is included out of the box on
nearly every <cite>Linux</cite> distribution I had ever worked with. May as well,&nbsp;right?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simplicity-but-not-much-else">
<h2>Simplicity, but not much&nbsp;else</h2>
<p>Once I began to get over the initial hurdle of finding my way around <cite>Vim</cite>, it
felt great. I was very impressed by what it could do, how quickly it worked,
and how lightweight it felt compared to my utterly destroyed <cite>Emacs</cite> config.</p>
<p>I actually found myself very happy with <cite>Vim</cite> and hardly felt the need to
install any plugins, or make heavy tweaks. Just my <a class="reference external" href="http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/">Zenburn</a> theme to match
my system, and some edits to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ncdulo/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc">.vimrc</a> file kept me quite content for a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>Several months of enjoyment and <cite>Python</cite> development work blew by me before I
began to feel limited again. I was missing my <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">org-mode</span></code>, ease of extending,
and just plain missing the power <cite>Emacs</cite> presented to&nbsp;me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vim-is-doomed">
<h2>Vim is&nbsp;Doomed</h2>
<p>While I was not entirely feeling extremely limited by <cite>Vim</cite>, it wasn&#8217;t the
end all be all that I originally felt it was. The built-in terminal support
felt lacking, and awkward to use so I made very heavy use of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C-z</span></code> to back
and forth as I worked on projects. It was almost distracting in a way, and
nearly always resulted in many forgotten instances of <cite>Vim</cite> floating around
various terminals. The lack of a decent GUI version was a bit limiting in it&#8217;s
own way. Not that I want flashy UI elements, or toolbars and such. I just find
a certain appeal to being able to launch my editor of choice in a dedicated
window and keep it open at all times. <cite>GVim</cite> was not my idea of that. I was
feeling limited, and watching much of the <cite>Mythical Crew</cite> get themselves onto
<cite>Emacs</cite> made me realize more what I was missing out&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Yet I didn&#8217;t want to go totally back to <cite>Emacs</cite>. I would have to re-learn the
keybinds and toss away much of what I learned during the few months in <cite>Vim</cite>.
To me, that left one main option. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">Evil mode</a>. It would allow me to use a
horrific combination of keybinds and functionality from both&nbsp;worlds.</p>
<p>I needed something that would come mostly pre-configured out of the box. With
sensible defaults, support for the languages and features I use, and the ability
to expand that setup as I find areas in need of adjustment to suit my&nbsp;flow.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a> was the first distribution that came to mind. But I <em>really</em> did
not like that when I tried it out some time ago. Couldn&#8217;t put my finger on it,
but something just felt off. It felt a bit heavier than what I wanted, and
did not seem to be as easily expandable without a deeper knowledge of <cite>Lisp</cite>.
Thus I took a pass on trying it&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Tossing around thoughts of a few of the previously mentioned distributions from
my original experience with <cite>Emacs</cite> had me feeling I was about to repeat the
process that got me into this mess in the first place. Something entirely new
to me was needed. Something like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">Doom Emacs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It is a story as old as time. A stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic
vimmer—envious of the features of modern text editors—spirals into despair
before he succumbs to the dark side. This is his&nbsp;config.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That alone was enough to tell me &#8212; <cite>Doom</cite> is your best shot at success. I had
to give it a shot. Admittedly, I was a bit thrown off by the inclusion of a
separate script for managing the <cite>Doom</cite> installation but I went ahead with it
anyway. As it turned out, everything went without a hitch and I find myself
actually grateful for that script. It made the installation, and future
management of my setup <em>much</em> easier and pain-free than I imagined it would
be. Nowhere near as much micromanagement of packages, user-config, or updates.
I was loving it from the first moment I fired it&nbsp;up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="welcome-back-home-i-ve-missed-you-emacs">
<h2>Welcome back home, I&#8217;ve missed you,&nbsp;Emacs</h2>
<p>Of course, the first few hours were spent struggling to discover my old
functionality or keybinds to properly use <cite>Doom</cite>. Slightly complicated in that
reading the official <cite>Emacs</cite> documentation wouldn&#8217;t help me with the keys. I
did catch my footing, and rediscovered the beautiful way <cite>Emacs</cite> is
self-documenting and incredibly helpful. It did not take me long to begin, to
some extent, proficient enough to begin using <cite>Emacs</cite> over <cite>Vim</cite>.</p>
<p>Granted, it hasn&#8217;t even been a week yet, and I&#8217;m nowhere near as proficient
as I was originally. With <cite>Evil mode</cite>, much of that re-learning was mitigated
and I feel comfortable handling basic edits and workspace management. Not to
mention how much more responsive and fluid working in <cite>Emacs</cite> feels.</p>
<p>Granted, we can&#8217;t let ourselves fall back into the same trap that got me before.
I have let myself settle into knowing the <cite>Doom</cite> setup is working very well for
my needs, and I <em>do not</em> actually need to write a configuration of tens of files
spanning hundreds (thousands?) of lines which hardly work together. It just
works. Make changes as they are needed, not because I might want a specific
feature some day in the distant future, if&nbsp;ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="off-into-the-sunset">
<h2>Off into the&nbsp;sunset</h2>
<p>Here we are now, comfortably writing this post in <cite>Doom Emacs</cite>, enjoying every
bit of it. Especially the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fill-paragraph</span></code> command. Words don&#8217;t even describe
the frustration I had at times, manually re-flowing a paragraph in <cite>Vim</cite> because
I changed a single word somewhere. I&#8217;ve even been taking the opportunity to give
<cite>Lisp</cite> a second shot. I haven&#8217;t actually created anything truly useful with it
yet, but I feel I am beginning to understand it. Much of that is thanks to Steve
Yegge&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/01/emergency-elisp.html">Emergency Elisp</a> post, which goes over the basics of <cite>Elisp</cite> syntax
in a way that actually makes sense to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t plan (for now at least) on writing the next <a class="reference external" href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a> or major
extension to <cite>Doom Emacs</cite>, I do have some ideas. Simple things that will make
my life easier when I work. Almost certainly these ideas will grow into
something larger over time. For now, I&#8217;m making it a point to just enjoy <cite>Emacs</cite>
and take it slow. No sense jumping right in to the deep end straight from the&nbsp;start.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to you, <cite>Emacs</cite>, and many more buffers to come in the days (years?) to
come. Thank you for taking me back, with a gentle and caring hand, right when I
needed you the&nbsp;most.</p>
