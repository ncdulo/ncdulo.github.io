.. description: Saving money & sanity during these difficult times with DIY.
.. type: text

Over the past couple of years, I found myself more and more interested in DIY
solutions. Part of that is the obvious, saving money. When you're already
stretched thin, every dollar you can save is a big help. But another part,
seemingly the bigger draw for me -- being able to say, "I did this". Having
the ability to take of things on your own, without reliance on other people, or
factors can really take a lot of stress off the mind. As the Coronavirus
pandemic continues to work through our world, there is a greater growing
interest in DIY once again. Seems as good a time as any to go over some of my
own ways for saving money, and getting things done on my own.

Beard Oil
---------
Since June of 2018, I have been growing a beard. Trim once a week, keep it
looking and feeling good. The secret to keeping it looking and feeling good?
Beard oil. Naturally, the hair of a beard will absorb the oils produced by your
face, and they will act to soften the hair and keep your skin from drying out.
Where the problem arises for some, especially with beards longer than a couple
weeks of growth, is that the skin cannot produce enough oil to keep up with how
much the hair needs. That is when the skin starts to dry out, and the dreaded
itchy beard presents itself. Or even worse -- beardruff!

Thus, for most of us growing beard, it is a necessity to keep it lightly oiled.
I personally don't go through a *huge* amount of beard oil. Maybe an ounce
every two to three months. That would still equate to about 5-7 purchases of
oil throughout the year. If we figure an average cost of about $15/ounce of oil
(and that's actually cheaper than many brands!), and 6 bottles purchased over
one year. The total cost would come out around $90. Gets expensive quick! And
unfortunately, a lot of the pre-made oils available in the grocery store use
ingredients that may actually be harmful to beard growth -- not cool. By mixing
your own, you know *exactly* what is in it, and can customize the blend so that
it is perfect for your own needs.

I won't be going into a huge breakdown of the ingredients, or costs for mixing
your own oils. There are plenty of resources online, which will be linked below.
However, I will list out the basic costs for my entry-point that got me started
mixing my own.

The order I placed initially was even a bit more expensive than it needed to be.
Several of the items could be considered optional if you don't care for any
extra scents in your oil. And of course, if you already have something, or find
an option you like better -- go for it! It's your oil, do what feels right and
works best for you.

Note: This would be much nicer to read organized into a table. Still *very* new
to the reStructuredText format so this will do, for now. Leaving this note as my
reminder to touch this up a bit in the future.

- Jojoba Oil, 4oz, $11

  - Base carrier oil, most closely resembles the natural oil of the skin. I use
    this in all of my blends.

- Castor Oil, 4oz, $4

  - Carrier oil, used to thicken up a thinner oil. I do not use more than a
    couple drops of this into a 1oz bottle of finished product.

- Meadowfoam Seed Oil, 4oz, $10

  - Incredibly light, and great feeling carrier oil. Leaves the skin feeling
    refreshed without a greasy/sunscreen sort of feel

- Essential Oils, 10ml, $5 and up

  - If you want to add your own scent into the oil, essential oils are the way
    to go. These highly concentrated, natural oils can have some wonderful
    scents and some are said to have benefits to your beard. Depending on the
    size of the bottle, and the brand, they can get quite pricey. When getting
    started out, I would advise to grab no more than a 10ml bottle at once, and
    *always* check for an allergic reaction before applying to your face. You
    will likely only be using a few drops at a time for the essential oils, so
    they will last a little bit.
  - Personally, the essential oils I purchased are Spruce, Peppermint, Balsam
    Fir, and Cedarwood. Currently, the only one I use is the Balsam Fir.

- Amber Glass Dropper Bottles with eye dropper, 12x 1oz, $10

  - You're gonna need something to store your mixes in. I recommend amber glass
    as it does the best job at blocking out UV light, which can cause some
    ingredients to degrade. Cobalt glass is fine as well, but I would stay away
    from the clear, or light colored glass bottles.

- Stainless Steel Mini-Funnels, 1.25" diameter, 6-pack, $7

  - I almost passed on these, but am very glad I decided to pick them up. They
    fit *perfectly* into the top of the 1oz glass dropper bottles. Makes for a
    very easy pour when adding ingredients into your blends. Can be omitted if
    you are using syringes to fill your bottles, or if you feel comfortable
    pouring the oil directly into a small opening. I recommend picking these up.

Finally, before moving on, I'd like to list a few of the resources I found to be
most helpful as I researched, and began mixing my own. BeardResource_ has a
wonderful introduction guide featuring some ingredient comparisons, example
recipes and tips. ToolsOfMen_ provides another huge guide, full of information
such as essential oil pairing notes, cost breakdowns, and mixing techniques.
And last, but not least -- BeardMountain_ has some great notes for a variety of
essential oils. Note that there *was* a part one to their article, but the link
seems to no longer be valid.

Haircuts
--------
One of my flaws is that I can never seem to get a haircut until it is far, far
overdue. One could argue that is a money-saving technique in itself, but I don't
think it is entirely that. At least for me. I just end up caught up with other
things, and don't really place haircuts high on my list of priorities most of
the time. Especially not when every cut sets me back around $25 or so. Not gonna
break the bank with that, but every dollar saved helps.

This can be a little bit tricky to get done in such a way that it looks good. In
particular if you are going to be cutting your own hair. You will get a lot
cleaner results if you can get someone to help you out for the neckline, and
detailing. If all you care for is a quick, and simple haircut. This can be a
great way to save money over time.

I'm still very new to cutting my own hair, only having done so once at the time
of this writing. Already I can tell that I'd much rather cut my own than deal
with getting over to the barber -- Sorry, Eddy! Originally, I had planned a few
years back to cut my own hair. Picked up a decent set of clippers with a variety
of guides for about $25 or $30. Got cold feet at the last minute and copped out.
Now that much of the world, and all of my local area has been put on hold while
Coronavirus makes its rounds, I found myself pushed back to cutting my own. Not
going to wait months (potentially) for business to re-open. I needed a haircut
*now*. Was able to get the cut down, all on my own, minus the neckline. Called
in some help for that one.

The finished results, I'm very happy with. No longer need to deal with my hair
all over the place, and each haircut from here on out will get cheaper and
cheaper. Considering I only paid around $25 for the hair clippers, this one has
paid for itself with only a single haircut. And with the potential to save me
about $100 anually that would normally go the barber, I am a very happy man.

This one had me a little nervous going into it. Did not want to screw up. Or cut
it so badly I would need to cut it all off. It turned out much much easier than
I had thought. A couple tips though..

- Start with the longest guides you have. Can always cut more off. But you can't
  add it back on.
- Get help for detailing, and the neckline
- Use a handheld mirror in combination with your bathroom mirror to see what
  you're doing on the back of your head. The angles can be quite tricky to line
  everything up right. It gets easier with practice.
- Do your first cut on the weekend, or when you have some time off. Should you
  happen to cut a little more off than you like, this will give you a few days
  so that it naturally blends itself in a bit as new hair grows.

Cooking
-------
Most people might not consider this a Do-It-Yourself thing. My question to that,
why not? Being able to cook edible food, and sustain yourself without having to
involve fast food or restaurants is great. And (possibly) healthier! Admittedly,
I did not cook much at all until I moved out on my own. No longer having anyone
around who might cook for me, and having to stock the pantry fully on my own.
That's kind of what pushed me into learning more, and trying some new things.

As it turns out, cooking can be damn simple at times. There are easily thousands
of recipes online for quick & easy meals. Just a quick DuckDuckGo_ search away.
I got myself started by writing down ideas I would have throughout the day for
things to eat. From there searching out recipes and writing them down in my
notebook. The notebook works great for me due to it being small enough to fit
in my pocket, and non-digital so I need not worry about batteries or network.
That makes it very easy to pull it out while grocery shopping and start
collecting your ingredients.

If you're like me, and like to cook in bulk, you can really save on money and
time spen cooking. One of my favorite foods to cook has been a Crock-pot Chili.
Incredibly simple to the point it's almost too easy. Yet complex enough to not
get boring, and very easy to tweak over time to perfection. I'm planning to
write out a separate post detailing the recipe and how I modified it to suit my
own tastes. But for now, I'll leave you with the original recipe from Food.com_.

Note the recipe does mention to be cooked in the oven. When I first found it, a
crock pot was suggested. That version seems to no longer exist. Whether I'm
looking in the wrong place, or if the linked version was updated, I'm not sure.
If you do want to try out that recipe in your crock pot, I cook mine for about
9-10 hours on low heat, but have gone up to 12 hours for larger batches.

In conclusion
-------------
Armed now with some basic, and accesible ideas to DIY your own solutions, it's
your turn now. Make yourself something nice, save a little money. I can promise
you experimenting and feeling of 'getting it done' will be very much worth the
time put in. Not to mention that along with saving money, a lot of the time you
get a product you like better in the end. After all, no one knows you better
than yourself!
