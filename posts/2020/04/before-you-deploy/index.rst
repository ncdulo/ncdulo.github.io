.. type: text

As a quick reminder -- before you go ahead and begin committing anything to
GitHub, there are a few other things you should handle first. Just a quick
check before going live ``[insert thumbsup emoji]``

- Remove test posts

  * Alternatively, tidy them up. Make them ready for publish.
  * Pokemon image (Licensing?)

- Remove remaining demo content
- All around final check of all processes

  - Post creation
  - All links and pages working
  - Content is correct
  - Theme is nice
