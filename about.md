# About
I enjoy learning about software and web development, system administration and game design. Self-taught in nearly all languages I know with the exception of a BASIC and C++ class I took in high school. Though by the end of each of those classes, I was doing more teaching than I was learning.

Having started with BASIC around the year 2000, I quickly moved forward and into web development. The ability to create a web page, upload and have it accessible to anyone on the Internet was very empowering and I spent many years working with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. Javascript was a sort of "no-man's land" for me. The first few attempts I made with the language were frustrating and did not result in me having any functional knowledge of the language. I do plan to remedy that soon.

## But first, Python!
My current programming fling which is subject to change at a moments notice with no prior warning or guarantee that I will finish any of the projects I have been starting on. The simplicity of the language has been captivating. Combined with the power of comprehensions, closures, and classes, I have been drawn in very quickly.
