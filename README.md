# ncdulo.github.io
This repo stores the build output generated by Nikola for `/dev/ncdulo`. The
full sources, including theme, and configuration are stored in a separate repo
for now. It is currently set to private until I determine the long-term method
I will use for hosting, and serving this content.

`/dev/ncdulo` is a blog, project showcase, and collection of thoughts. Explore
and learn with tutorials, opinions and guides about Gentoo Linux, Python, Web
Development, and a variety of other topics.

"Nikola [is a] static site generator. In goes content, out comes a website, ready
to deploy." - [GetNikola.com](https://getnikola.com)

Nikola supports a wide variety of configurations, and features. When provided
source files such as reStructuredText, Markdown, or HTML, it can generate a
static collection of HTML and CSS files which function together as a proper
website. As source files are updated, and then rebuilt, the output is deployed
to a web server to be made available over the internet. And thus, a website
is born.
