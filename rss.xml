when I moved out of my parent's house it's cooking. Not that I relied heavily on
my mom much for food -- I was pretty good at covering my own expenses when
living at home. But you don't truly realize &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that is already taken
care of for you until you have to take care of everything yourself. You know,
the little things. Keeping a well stocked pantry. Having a wide variety of
cooking utensils and devices. Making sure the rent check is out on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being out on my own has really given me a good push to branch out into cooking
more, expand my horizons, and gain more ambition in what I cook. You can't just
live off of Pizza Rolls and M&amp;amp;M's forever -- it starts to get boring after a bit.
Though I have had some great results at times, I've also had some not so great
results. Tonight's dinner was actually pretty good, but I made a few mistakes
along the way and learned a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

Somewhere I can
write about the things on my mind. Somewhere I can share, or catalog the bits
and pieces of information I pick up over time. I've even made a few attempts at
it before, with various levels of effort and completion. Yet for the most part,
I have not stuck with previous attempts long term. Most of them falling into
inactivity not long after the first or second post was made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through this process again, I'm not going to say, "this time will be
different". I will say that I've been very much enjoying this, and having fun
with it. Something I'm not sure I did in some previous attempts. There are also
several notable differences to me that seem to factor in to play here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gentoo.org/"&gt;Gentoo Linux&lt;/a&gt;. It allows packages to be configured, built from source, and
installed onto the system with a minimal of fuss and manual configuration. When
compared to the traditional &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make install&lt;/code&gt; of many
software packages, &lt;cite&gt;Portage&lt;/cite&gt; provides a far nicer and more streamlined process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Portage&lt;/cite&gt; ships with a very sensible default configuration, but for most of us
on &lt;cite&gt;Gentoo&lt;/cite&gt; -- there is near always room to further streamline the process. In
this post, I detail the tweaks and enhancements I have enabled for the &lt;cite&gt;Gentoo&lt;/cite&gt;
install on my desktop. I would consider these to be "safe" enhancements in that
most should not negatively impact the system. Exceptions to that are noted
within.&lt;/p&gt;

I truly do enjoy Python version bumps. With &lt;cite&gt;Python 2&lt;/cite&gt; at EOL,
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gentoo.org/"&gt;Gentoo Linux&lt;/a&gt; making big moves over the past couple of months to bump the
Python3 default target to &lt;cite&gt;Python 3.7&lt;/cite&gt;, it has been a very exciting time for
me to be working so much with Python. Though a bit confusing at times, the
care and attention put in by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Python"&gt;Gentoo Python Team&lt;/a&gt; has made this an easier
transition to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

sensible way to maintain this website in a &lt;cite&gt;Git&lt;/cite&gt; repository. Right under my
nose it looks like there is a great solution. Not sure how I missed this way
of handling it so easily. This guide was written with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; in mind, but it
can be applied to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; project repo on your &lt;cite&gt;GitHub&lt;/cite&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt;

It's
infancy began some months ago, but never quite got off the ground. Then about a
week ago, a rekindled interest sparked up. And just like that -- here we are!
Reaching a point now where I feel comfortable with this base, I'd like to get
this online. For final testing, and of course to open up for visitors. These
are my final thoughts as I prepare for a proper deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

solutions. Part of that is the obvious, saving money. When you're already
stretched thin, every dollar you can save is a big help. But another part,
seemingly the bigger draw for me -- being able to say, "I did this". Having
the ability to take of things on your own, without reliance on other people, or
factors can really take a lot of stress off the mind. As the Coronavirus
pandemic continues to work through our world, there is a greater growing
interest in DIY once again. Seems as good a time as any to go over some of my
own ways for saving money, and getting things done on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

GitHub, there are a few other things you should handle first. Just a quick
check before going live &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;[insert thumbsup emoji]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove test posts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, tidy them up. Make them ready for publish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pokemon image (Licensing?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove remaining demo content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All around final check of all processes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post creation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All links and pages working&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content is correct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme is nice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>important</category><guid>https://ncdulo.github.io/posts/2020/04/before-you-deploy/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 01:21:50 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
